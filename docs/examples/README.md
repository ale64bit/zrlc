# ZRL Examples

These examples provide an introduction to ZRL. Basic familiarity with programming, the graphics pipeline, shading languages and C++ is assumed. All the examples use [bazel](https://bazel.build/) as build system and assume you have a working ZRL compiler (check the [Building the compiler](../../README.md) section).
